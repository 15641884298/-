&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance between privacy and management rights: Although companies have the right to manage their employees, this power is not unlimited. Enterprises must ensure that their employees' personal privacy rights are not violated when conducting employee monitoring or searches. For example, companies can inspect the work equipment assigned to employees, but cannot search employees' personal belongings without reason.
Handling in special circumstances: In certain special circumstances, such as emergency public health incidents or situations explicitly stipulated by law, companies may collect and use personal information without violating employees' privacy rights.</font></p>
                 <h2><font color="#F0F0F0" face="Oswald">Clarify legal responsibilities</font></h2><p><br><font color="whitesmoke">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strict punishment measures: For enterprises that violate personal data protection regulations, the newly revised law sets high fines and other possible business restrictions, such as suspending business or revoking business licenses.
Rights relief mechanism: Individuals have the right to withdraw their consent to the use of personal information at any time and may request companies to stop using their personal information. If an individual believes that their data rights have been violated, they can directly file a complaint or file a lawsuit with regulatory agencies.</font></p>
